# 🧠 Inquizitive – Real-time Classroom Polling App

[🌐 Live Demo](https://inquizitive-7.vercel.app/) • [📂 GitHub Repo](https://github.com/TanmaySingh007/Inquizitive)

Inquizitive is a real-time, interactive classroom polling platform built with **React + TypeScript**, **Express + TypeScript**, and **Socket.IO**. Teachers can ask live questions, and students can respond in real time—with a smooth and responsive UI.

---

## ✨ Features

### 👩‍🏫 Teacher
- Create and send live poll questions
- View live poll results as students respond
- Enforced rule: new question only allowed when the previous one is closed
- Poll auto-ends after all students answer or 60 seconds pass

### 👨‍🎓 Student
- Join using a tab-unique name (stored in session only)
- Submit a response once a poll is live
- View real-time results after submitting or timeout
- Auto-submission not required—poll closes regardless after 60s

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TanmaySingh007/Inquizitive
cd Inquizitive
```

### 2️⃣ Setup Backend (Express + TS)

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev    # Uses ts-node-dev
```

> 📍 Runs on `http://localhost:5000`

**Important for Production:** Make sure your backend server is deployed and accessible. Update the `VITE_SOCKET_URL` environment variable in your frontend deployment to point to your backend server URL.

### 3️⃣ Setup Frontend (React + TS)

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev    # or npm start depending on your setup
```

> 📍 Opens `http://localhost:3000`

### 🌐 Production Deployment

1. **Backend Deployment**: Deploy your `server/` folder to a service like:
   - Render
   - Railway
   - Heroku
   - DigitalOcean App Platform

2. **Frontend Deployment**: Deploy your frontend to:
   - Vercel
   - Netlify
   - GitHub Pages

3. **Environment Configuration**: Set the `VITE_SOCKET_URL` environment variable in your frontend deployment to point to your backend server URL.

   Example:
   ```
   VITE_SOCKET_URL=https://your-backend-app.onrender.com
   ```

## 🧪 Local Usage

| Role     | Path                    | Description                    |
|----------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Teacher  | `/teacher`              | Create and manage polls        |
| Student  | `/student`              | Join, answer, view results     |

---

## 🧠 Logic Summary

- When teacher posts a question → it's broadcasted via Socket.IO
- Student receives the question and submits an answer
- Server tracks answers per socket ID
- After 60 seconds or all students answer → `poll-ended` event is fired
- All clients receive live results during and after the poll
